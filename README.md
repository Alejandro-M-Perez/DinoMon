##Dino Tamagotchi
##Inspiration
Our inspiration for Dino Tamagotchi came from [mention the source of inspiration or idea].

##What it does
Dino Tamagotchi is a unique project that involves a Raspberry Pi running a website, allowing users to connect and interact with a virtual dinosaur within an egg. The onboard computer tracks time, updating the dinosaur's condition, and prompts the player for interaction.

##How we built it
To bring Dino Tamagotchi to life, we designed a 3D-printed enclosure that not only housed the components but also provided support for the screen, ensuring portability. This involved overcoming challenges with new systems, such as node.js, asset creation, system design, and integration.

##Challenges we ran into
Throughout the project, we faced numerous challenges, especially as we delved into unfamiliar territories with node.js, asset creation, system design, and integration. Overcoming these hurdles was a crucial part of the development process.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team takes pride in achieving a robust interaction system and creating a compact form factor that is portable even in prototype form.

##What we learned
The Dino Tamagotchi project taught us valuable skills, including how to create and host websites as interfaces, pixel art creation, and the development of portable computers.

##What's next for Dino Tamagotchi
In the future, we plan to enhance Dino Tamagotchi by adding physical buttons and an internal battery, making it even more user-friendly and versatile.- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eternoos
